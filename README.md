## 🦾Challenges
- Learning XML:

    - Initially, I didn’t know XML and sometimes used deprecated terms.

    - Struggled with naming conventions, which caused the module not to run.

- Understanding Security Folder:

    - Unsure how to configure it and what it meant.

    - Writing code without understanding the purpose was confusing.

- Overcoming Confusion with Module Structure:

     - Watched tutorials and created a test module to practice.

     - Helped me understand Odoo modules before creating the final module.

- Persistence:
     - My never-give-up mindset helped me learn, experiment, and finally complete the Student            Management module successfully.
